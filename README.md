OpenIntro Labs
==============

OpenIntro Labs promote the understanding and application of statistics through 
applied data analysis. Labs are titled based on topic area, which correpond to 
particular chapters in all three versions of OpenIntro Statistics, a free and 
open-source textbook. The textbook as well as the html version of the labs can
be found at [http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php](http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php).

We currently support our source files in the .Rmd format, which can be output into
html format (though output to pdf is also possible). The source files are processed
using the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package in R. If you are using RStudio, 
be sure that you've adjusted your settings to compile source files using this
package. If you are unfamiliar with working with these file types, you may consider
creating your own copy of the Google Doc version of each lab, which are archived at
[http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php](http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php). 
These versions are not currently supported, so they will differ slightly from the
.Rmd labs found here.

It is our hope that these materials are useful for instructors and students of 
statistics.  If you end up developing some interesting variants of these labs or 
creating new ones, please let us know!
